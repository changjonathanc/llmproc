    file descriptors.


    When a user sends a very large message:

    1. It will be automatically converted to a file descriptor (e.g., fd:1)

    2. You''ll receive a preview and the file descriptor ID

    3. You can use read_fd to access the full content


    For example, if the user pastes a 10,000 character document:

    - You''ll see: <fd:1 preview="First few hundred characters..." type="user_input"
    size="10000">

    - You can then use: read_fd(fd="fd:1", read_all=true) to see the full input

    - Or you can read it in chunks: read_fd(fd="fd:1", start=0, count=3)


    This system helps you work with inputs that would otherwise exceed context limits.

    When you see a file descriptor in user input, always read it first before responding.

  user: 'I''m going to paste a very large text here, which will automatically become
    a file descriptor. Here it is:

    [Repeat the above paragraph 20 times to exceed the character limit and trigger
    file descriptor creation]


    When you receive this as a file descriptor:

    1. Show how to read the first page of the file descriptor

    2. Show how to read just the first 5 lines

    3. Show how to read the entire content

    4. Explain how this feature helps with large documents
