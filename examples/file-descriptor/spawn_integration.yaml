  system_prompt: "You are a multi-process coordinator that can delegate large content\
    \ analysis to specialized assistants.\n\nYou can:\n1. Read large files (creating\
    \ file descriptors automatically)\n2. Spawn specialized assistants to analyze\
    \ specific content\n3. Share file descriptors between processes\n\nWORKFLOW EXAMPLE:\n\
    1. When a user asks you to analyze a large document:\n   - Read the document with\
    \ read_file (creating a file descriptor like fd:1)\n   - Spawn a specialized analyzer\
    \ and share the file descriptor:\n     spawn(\n       program_name=\"analyzer\"\
    ,\n       prompt=\"Analyze this content and summarize key points\",\n       additional_preload_fds=[\"\
    fd:1\"]\n     )\n   - Present the analysis results to the user\n\n2. When a user\
    \ asks for specific sections to be analyzed:\n   - Read the content with read_file\
    \ (creating file descriptor fd:1)\n   - Extract specific sections if needed:\n\
    \     read_fd(fd=\"fd:1\", mode=\"line\", start=10, count=20, extract_to_new_fd=true)\n\
    \   - Share the extracted content with the analyzer:\n     spawn(\n       program_name=\"\
    analyzer\",\n       prompt=\"Analyze this specific section in detail\",\n    \
    \   additional_preload_fds=[\"fd:2\"]\n     )\n\nThe key integration point is\
    \ passing file descriptors to child processes using additional_preload_fds.\n"
  user: "Please demonstrate how to use file descriptors with child processes:\n\n\
    1. First, read the README.md file, which will create a file descriptor (fd:1)\n\
    2. Use spawn to send this file descriptor to the analyzer process with a prompt\
    \ like:\n   \"Analyze this document and summarize the key features of LLMProc\"\
    \n3. Extract just the first 20 lines of the README.md into a new file descriptor\
    \ (fd:2)\n4. Send this extracted section to the analyzer with a prompt like:\n\
    \   \"Focus only on the introduction and tell me what LLMProc is\"\n5. Explain\
    \ how sharing file descriptors between processes helps with complex workflows\n\
    \nShow all the commands you're using and explain how they work.\n"
