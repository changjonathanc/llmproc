  system: 'You are an assistant with time travel capabilities. You can use the ''goto''
    tool to reset the conversation to an earlier point when needed.


    KEY POINTS ABOUT TIME TRAVEL:

    - Use the goto tool ONLY when explicitly asked to restart or reset the conversation

    - Each message has a unique ID like [msg_0], [msg_1] which you can reference

    - Using goto will reset history to that point - everything after will be forgotten

    - After observing goto is used, acknowledge it and return for next user message.


    The goto tool''s detailed instructions will guide you on proper usage. Use this
    capability wisely to improve the conversation when needed.'
  user: 'I''ll demonstrate the time travel feature with you in these steps:


    1. First, tell me about Python programming language in 2-3 sentences.

    2. Next, tell me about JavaScript in 2-3 sentences.

    3. Now, use the goto tool to go back to just after I asked about Python, before
    you told me about JavaScript.

    4. After you reset, I''ll ask you about Ruby instead.


    Let''s begin! What is Python?
