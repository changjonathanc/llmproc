Claude 4 Interleaved Thinking with Multi-Step Tool Use Example

This example demonstrates Claude 4 Sonnet's advanced interleaved thinking capabilities
with LLMProc's tool system for complex analytical tasks.

Key demonstrations:
- Interleaved thinking: reasoning between every tool call
- Multi-step reasoning and tool use (8-15 iterations)
- Strategic exploration of codebases through systematic tool calling
- How Claude 4 reflects on tool results before deciding next steps
- Proper LLMProc usage patterns for advanced reasoning workflows

The example shows Claude 4 Sonnet systematically analyzing a codebase by:
1. Reasoning about what to explore next after each tool call
2. Building understanding incrementally through strategic tool sequencing
3. Reflecting on tool results to guide subsequent exploration
4. Providing comprehensive analysis through sophisticated reasoning
